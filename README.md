# TRACKME
Tasker and Keen.io Track Me application

I have renamed the tasker useerback file to userbackup_TRACKME.xml

This is to avoid risky file overwite.

If you want to use this file rename it to userbackup.xml
Place it in main Tasker folder in your phone
Restore the data from tasker menu

Please note that this will overwrite any existing profile, task and scene

Use it at your risk.

thnx
